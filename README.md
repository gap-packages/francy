# Francy

Francy is a framework for Interactive Discrete Mathematics package for GAP.

Unlike [XGAP](https://github.com/gap-packages/xgap), Francy is not linked with any GUI framework and instead, 
this package is responsible for the generating a semantic model that can be used to produce a graphical representation using any other framework / language.

See [Graphics Semantics package for GAP](/gap)

As an example, there is javascript implementation of the graphical representation that works in Jupyter, embeded in a web page or as a desktop application (e.g. using electron).

See [Graphics Interface using Javascritp and D3.v4](/js)
