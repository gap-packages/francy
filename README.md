# Francy

Francy is a package for GAP that provides a framework for Interactive Discrete Mathematics.

Unlike [XGAP](https://github.com/gap-packages/xgap), Francy is not linked with any GUI framework and instead, 
this package is responsible for the generation of a semantic model that can be used to produce a graphical representation using any other framework / language.

See [Official Documentation](https://gap-packages.github.io/francy/doc/chap1.html)

There is javascript module responsible for generating a graphical representation of the semantic model,
that works on Jupyter, embedded in a Web page or as a Desktop Application (e.g. using electron).

See [Graphics Interface](/js)

# Jupyter Integration

In order to use this module in JupyterLab, install it as follows:

```bash
mcmartins@local:~$ pip install -U jupyterlab-francy
```

If you still use the old JupyterNotebooks, you should use the latest version supported, v1.2.4:

```bash
mcmartins@local:~$ pip install -U jupyter-francy
```

This extension requires the JupyterKernel GAP package to be installed. 
See [Jupyter GAP Kernel](https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel) for more information.

## Releasing

All developments should happen on the branch `develop` and this should be merged into `master` when one is happy to release.

To update the JS packages version, run the following command and pick the new version:

```bash
user@local js/ $ yarn run version
```

To update the Python PyPi.org package version please update the version on:

* `js/packages/francy-extension-jupyterlab/pypproject.toml`

To release, the official [ReleaseTools](https://github.com/gap-system/ReleaseTools) procedure should be followed.

There are 2 workflows defined for this project:

* CI - This workflow runs all tests (JS and GAP) for every commit/pull request on branches `develop` and `master`
* RELEASE - This workflow runs the Python PyPi.org and NPM releases on new `tag`s created, normally after running the [ReleaseTools](https://github.com/gap-system/ReleaseTools) procedure.
