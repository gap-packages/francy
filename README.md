# Francy

Francy is a framework for Interactive Discrete Mathematics built for [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) - 
Groups, Algorithms, Programming - a System for Computational Discrete Algebra.

Unlike [XGAP](https://github.com/gap-packages/xgap), Francy is not linked with any GUI framework and instead, 
this package generates a semantic model of data structures that can be used to produce a graphical representation
of these, using any other framework / language.

See [Official Documentation](https://gap-packages.github.io/francy/doc/chap1.html)

We provide a Javascript module able to produce graphical representations of the semantic model,
that works on Jupyter environments, embedded in a Web page or as a Desktop Application (e.g. using electron).

See [Graphics Interface](/js)

# Jupyter Integration

In order to use this module in JupyterLab and Notebook >=7.0.0, install it as follows:

```bash
mcmartins@local:~$ pip install -U jupyterlab-francy
```

If you still use the old Jupyter Notebook (<7.0.0), you should use the old extension v1.2.4:

```bash
mcmartins@local:~$ pip install -U jupyter-francy
```

Please note that in order to use `Francy`, it is required that the `JupyterKernel` GAP package is installed. 
See [Jupyter GAP Kernel](https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel) for more information.

## Releasing

All developments should happen on the branch `develop` and this should be merged into `master` when one is happy to release.

To release, the official [ReleaseTools](https://github.com/gap-system/ReleaseTools) procedure should be followed.

### Versioning

To update the JS packages version, run the following command and pick the new version:

```bash
user@local js/ $ yarn run version
```

To update the Python3 package version, please change it on the `pyproject.toml`:

* `js/packages/francy-extension-jupyterlab/pypproject.toml`

### CI / CD Pipelines

There are 2 workflows defined for this project:

* CI - This workflow runs all tests (JS and GAP) for every commit/pull request on branches `develop` and `master`
* RELEASE - This workflow runs the Python PyPi.org and NPM releases on new `tag`s created, normally after running the 
* [ReleaseTools](https://github.com/gap-system/ReleaseTools) procedure.
