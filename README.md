# Francy

Francy is a package for GAP and provides a framework for Interactive Discrete Mathematics.

Unlike [XGAP](https://github.com/gap-packages/xgap), Francy is not linked with any GUI framework and instead, 
this package is responsible for the generation of a semantic model that can be used to produce a graphical representation using any other framework / language.

See [Graphics Semantics Package for GAP](/gap)

There is javascript implementation of the graphical representation that works on Jupyter, embeded in a Web page or as a Desktop Application (e.g. using electron).

See [Graphics Interface using Javascritp and D3.v4](/js)

## Binder 

The binder includes all packages from `bootstrap-pkg-full`, plus:

[Francy-Monoids](https://github.com/gap-packages/FrancyMonoids)

[Jupyter GAP Kernel](https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel)

# Jupyter Integration

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/jupyter-francy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/jupyter-francy)

In order to use this module in Jupyter, install it as follows, both jupyter lab and notebook extension:

```bash
mcmartins@local:~$ pip install jupyter_francy
```

The jupyter extension requires that the GAP Kernel and Francy GAP, both, are installed.

See [Jupyter GAP Kernel](https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel)
